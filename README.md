This is my first ever self-made website using html.
I created a Music Therapy website to help people listen music based on their moods.
This makes it easier by providing mood-wise music instead of searching for a perfect song every time.
I had a great experience in making this website and it helped me understand basics of website structures.
Looking forward to develop more such websites and also learning CSS.
